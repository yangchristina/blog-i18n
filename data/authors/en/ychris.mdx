Hi there! My name is Christina, and I am the developer of [Planda.ca](https://planda.ca) and [CelebrateThisMortal.com](https://celebratethismortal.com/).

I am graduating this month from UBC with a degree in Computer Science. My passions lie in entrepreneurship, and I would love especially to work in a startup one day.

{/* Ask me about any Planda related questions. I love talking about Planda! &#128522; */}

Ask me any questions about Planda, CelebrateThisMortal, birthdays, UBC, or anything else! I'm happy to help. &#128522;
I also love talking and learning about new producitivy techniques, so would love to hear from you if you have any tips or tricks to share!
