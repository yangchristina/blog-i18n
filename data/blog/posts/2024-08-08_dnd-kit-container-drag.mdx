<b>SOLUTION</b>: Do not use `transform` variable from `useDraggable`.

In hindsight this was a really dumb mistake, but it's plagued me for a while.

This is actually written in the docs, but not super clearly.

> Depending on your use-case, you may want to use a drag overlay rather than transforming the original draggable source element that is connected to the useDraggable hook:

Key point being:
<b>"rather than transforming the original draggable source element"</b>

Under the [drag overlay section](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/draggable/drag-overlay), shows an example of using Draggable.tsx with DragOverlay:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/core';

function Draggable(props) {
  const {attributes, listeners, setNodeRef} = useDraggable({
    id: props.id,
  });

  return (
    <li ref={setNodeRef} {...listeners} {...attributes}>
      {props.children}
    </li>
  );
}
```

This is the original example under [the general draggable section](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/draggable), that I now know does NOT work with DragOverlay:

```tsx
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/core';
import {CSS} from '@dnd-kit/utilities';


function Draggable() {
  const {attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform} = useDraggable({
    id: 'unique-id',
  });
  const style = {
    transform: CSS.Translate.toString(transform),
  };

  return (
    <button ref={setNodeRef} style={style} {...listeners} {...attributes}>
      /* Render whatever you like within */
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Lessons learned
- If it doesn't work for you, but it works in the demo, then look at the code for the demo, and spot the differences.
