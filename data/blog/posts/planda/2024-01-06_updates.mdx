### Updates
- Add course names in new user quiz
- Upgrading syllabus parser
    - [New form](https://planda.ca/syllabus) for editing results of syllabus parser. It is much larger and more detailed than the old form. It also renders PDF or text file beside the form, so users can check the syllabus parser's work more easily
    - [linkify](https://linkify.js.org/) is now used to find links in a syllabus, no longer using OpenAI for this.
    - Finding office hours from course syllabus has been significantly optimized for OpenAI costs, and accuracy is improved
    - Improvements in overall accuracy of the syllabus parser - accomplished by improving the algorithm for splitting a syllabus into different sections
