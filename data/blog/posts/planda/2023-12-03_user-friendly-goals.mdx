### Common user errors
- New users often don't see that you can add categories
    - Proposed solution: A fun quiz when users make an account, that will create some custom options, including a few courses to get started.
- Cannot find task-display options, don't know how to remove subtasks from view
    - ask some of these options in quiz, otherwise make button pop out a bit more, or color the icon in.

### Target: Easter eggs
I want Planda features to feel like easter eggs that users discover. Feature lists scare people off, simplicity is always best. I'd love to keep surprising users. My vision for Planda is that it starts extremely simply, but you can choose to make is as complex as you want, slowly as you learn and get to know Planda. We were talking about AI Directors in gaming in one of my classes, and I want my main panda mascot to act as the AI Director. It would be great if every user felt a sense of uniqueness about **their** Planda.
