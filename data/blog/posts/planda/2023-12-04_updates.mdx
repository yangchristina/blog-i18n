### New feature highlight: panda animations on task completion
When you complete a task, you get a 1/3 chance of having a panda animation show up for ~5 seconds, and a 1/5 chance of confetti.

Currently this is really simple, using lottie for panda animations, useContext to make it show, and Framer motion for entrance/exit animations. Confetti is done with react-confetti-explosion. I want to put it out there for a bit, and get some feedback on how users like it, before I add more animations + fun transitions.

Michele suggested that there should be a tiny chance of a really crazy entrance animation, where the panda flies all over the screen. I think that will be fun. I also need to add a section in the settings that allow you to disable these animations, as I don't want them to feel intrusive.
