TLDR: used CSS contains

This is more of a bullet-point summary of this article: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/contain/
I will refer the an element with `contains` not `none` as "this element"

- descendants independent of document tree
- descendants will think of this element as the document tree
- It will act fully as if the element is the document tree if you do `contain: strict`, but you can also slice up parts of the functionality to only apply certain aspects
- `layout`, `paint`, `size`, and  ~~`style`~~ are the different aspects
- `layout` affects whether other elements outside of this element can see this??? idk
- `vh` and `vw` of descendents will be relative to this element with `contains` with `size` set

Default is `contain: none`

##### Shorthands
`contain: content` == `contain: layout paint`
`contain: strict` == `contain: layout paint size`

#### Layout
