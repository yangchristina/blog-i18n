TLDR: Used React ref to track the height of the fixed element, then set that to the height of a `position: relative` empty div.

## Introduction
I used this to create a scroll over effect you can see if you scroll on my e-card website [here](https://celebratethismortal.com).

## How I did it

My fixed element had a height that changes on certain conditions, so I used `ResizeObserver`, however if you have an element with a static height,
you can simply set the element height outside of the resize observer.

{/* TODO: do you put setState in callback deps? */}
### With fixed element of dynamic height
```js
const elementRef = useCallback((node: HTMLDivElement) => {
    if (!node) return;
    const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(() => {
        setElementHeight(node.getBoundingClientRect().height)
    });
    resizeObserver.observe(node);
}, []);
```

### With fixed element of static height
```js
const elementRef = useCallback((node: HTMLDivElement) => {
    if (!node) return;
    setElementHeight(node.getBoundingClientRect().height)
}, [deps_go_here]);
```

### With HTML
Finally, assign the ref to the fixed element, and give the placeholder div a low z-index.
You could also use `user-select: none` and `pointer-events: none` instead of the z-index, to allow clicking through.

```jsx
<div
    ref={elementRef}
    className={`fixed`}
>
    {children}
</div>
<div style={{ height: elementHeight }} className='relative -z-30' ></div>
```
I used Tailwind here, but you can do the same with css `position: fixed` and `position:relative; z-index: -30`
